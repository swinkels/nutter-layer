* Description
This layer installs [[https://github.com/swinkels/nutter][nutter]], an Emacs Lisp package to create and search notes in
directories of org-mode files, and configures its keybindings.

# ** Features:
#   - Autocomplete
#   - Lint
#   - Refactor
#   - ...

* Install
To use this configuration layer, you have to do two things. First, you add
=nutter= to the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in your =~/.spacemacs=.
Second, you clone the current repo into =~/.emacs.d/private=, which is a
directory that Spacemacs searches for layers that are not part of Spacemacs
itself:
#+begin_example
$ cd ~/.emacs.d/private
$ git clone https://github.com/swinkels/nutter-layer nutter
#+end_example

Note that the name of the directory is =nutter= instead of =nutter-layer=. Why
not name the current repo =nutter= then? That's because the Emacs Lisp package
that implements the functionality is already called =nutter=. The layer names in
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= all lack a =-layer= suffix and the layer for
=nutter= follows that convention.

* Key bindings
